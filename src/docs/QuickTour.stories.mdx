# StorybookJS Quick Tour

### If you are new to StorybookJS, here is a quick walk through of the Storybook UI.

1. On the left hand side, you will see a tab called "Components", under which is a list of each component I implemented. To view a component, simply click on a component's name and then select the desired "story" from that components drop down, for instance "Default" or "Primary".
2. From here, you will see the component in the center pane. You can interact with the component as you normally would any other web component. You can click on it, hover over it, etc.. You can also play around with the state and display text of the component the "Controls" tab in the bottom pane.
3. For further fun, check out the "Actions" tab in the bottom pane to see any mock event handling (or ["actions"](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/actions) as Storybook calls them) you might have executed when you clicked-on or hovered-over the component. For instance, if you click on the "Button" component, the "Actions" tab will log an event called `handleClick` to confirm that the button is in fact set up to handle data.
   Also, **don't forget to checkout the "Themes" tab** in the bottom pane for the components that are tagged as "Theme Support"! (Currently, only the components which have alternative themes in the [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/817436609226882468) I followed, and a few extra, have themes in this storybook. See the "Future Features" section in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Hamm-J/Storybook-React-UI-Kit) for details about my future plans.)
4. If any questions come up, you can of course consult the [StorybookJS docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction).
